# Street Lighting Control

Technical overview of street and urban lighting control architectures.

This section describes how modern street lighting systems are designed to optimize energy consumption, reduce operational costs, improve safety, and enable scalable city-wide control.

## Covered topics

- Cabinet and segment (group) control
- Individual luminaire control (NEMA, Zhaga, in-luminaire nodes)
- Communication technologies:
  - PLC (Power Line Communication)
  - Sub-GHz RF (868 / 915 MHz)
  - GSM / LTE / cellular IoT
- Sensor-based adaptive lighting
- Solar-powered and off-grid systems
- Central Management Systems (CMS) and Smart City integration

The focus is on system architecture, control logic, and engineering trade-offs.
